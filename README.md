Led candle with push button and timer for auto power off

![Candle PCB and case](candle_pic1.png)

A project for my [childs room-sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvMHdN5_T0Q), it is a candle:
- with auto power off after 10 minutes
- nice and harmonic flicker effects (not aggressive)
- durable, will not be empty after 1 night. Should works for 1 year.
- small, so you can place it in a standard tea-light candle.

It works with an ATTiny45V (Arduino project)

Design and PCB are open source and hosted on Easy Eda:
